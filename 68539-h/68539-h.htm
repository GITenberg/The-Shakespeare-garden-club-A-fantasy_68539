<p>SCENE: A room in Ann Hathaway’s cottage at Stratford-on-Avon.
Furnishing in keeping with the period.</p>

<p>(As curtain rises Ann is in the act of placing chairs,
benches etc., in a semi-circle around the room; in center of
circle is a long chest to be used as desk for the presiding
officer.</p>

<p>Noise is heard at door. Ann runs and opens same.
Enter Mistress Page and Mistress Ford,—with animated flutter).</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>ANN: Mistress Page (kisses) and Mistress Ford (more
kisses). No finer sight ere greeted eye than you two
dear ladies—nor never did I need you more.</p>

<p>PAGE: How now?</p>

<p>FORD: And why is this?</p>

<p>ANN: Forsooth, ’tis a meeting here to-day of the Shakespeare
Garden Club—and like to be grave and solemn, so
none better than you Merry Wives of Windsor to cheer
me up.</p>

<p>PAGE: A meeting—a-lack-a-day—may we stay? We are
not members.</p>

<p>ANN: Oh, you are my guests—and most welcome.</p>

<p>FORD: Do we know the ladies?</p>

<p>ANN: Nearly all, I trow, there’s the President, Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>PAGE: She was ever all dignity—and ambition.</p>

<p>ANN: And the Secretary is Portia, the attorney-at-law.</p>

<p>FORD: A-la-la, she’ll make you toe the mark.</p>

<p>ANN: Jessica, Shylock’s daughter, is Treasurer.</p>

<p>PAGE: No one dares owe dues to her, I’ll warrant.</p>

<p>ANN: But sit you down, and have a merry gossip together.
Methinks the ladies do arrive.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Knock on door. Perdita enters, greeting and handshaking)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>ANN: (Aside to wives as Perdita crosses stage and takes
chair at end) You remember the Winters’ Tale they
told of her? (Wives nod energetically)</p>

<p>ANN: And here comes Desdemona, wife of Othello.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Desdemona. (sits by Perdita)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: (aside) How could she ever have married that
horrid black man?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Cordelia.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: I have never met her, she’s daughter to King
Lear, a cranky father and hard to please, but she’s a
lovely religious woman.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p class="center">Enter Katherine.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: Why that’s Petrucio’s wife, the one they called
the Shrew, she hath an untamed twinkle in her eye.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Jessica.</p>

<p class="center">(sits at table)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: Shylock’s daughter, she keeps him guessing I’ll
warrant.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Rosalind.</p>

<p class="center">(in man’s attire)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: That must be Rosalind, she always did love the
doublet and hose, but—as you like it—so do it, say I.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Portia.</p>

<p class="center">(Mortar-board and gown)</p>

<p class="center">(Sits at center table.)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: ’Tis Portia, the lawyer, and most successful. She’ll
win a case tho it be for the Queen or only for a pound
of flesh.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Juliet.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: That’s Romeo’s wife, Juliet Capulet that was; for
a run-away match I hear they’re very happy.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Titania.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: There’s a woman I cannot understand. She seems
ever to dwell in a sort of Midsummer Night’s Dream.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Ophelia.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PAGE: That girl gives me the shivers, tho some say she
makes a fine wife to that melancholy Dane named
Hamlet.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">Enter Cleopatra.</p>

<p class="center">(Regally attired in Egyptian draperies)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>FORD: My word! ’Tis well our husbands are not here,
that woman is a vampire.</p>

<p class="center">(Enter in numbers minor characters and take
seats, much chatting, laughing, etc., until)</p>

<p class="center">Enter Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p class="center">(All rise and bow, she takes seat at center of
table and raps)</p>

<p class="center">The meeting comes to order.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>LADY MACBETH: (rising and speaking with much dignity)
Ladies of the Shakespeare Garden Club: We
have a long and arduous meeting before us. Do I impose
too much upon the milk of human kindness when
I beg that the minutes of the previous meeting be
omitted?</p>

<p>PORTIA: (Jumping to her feet) I do protest, Madam,
there is no power in Stratford that can alter a decree
established.</p>

<p>KATHERINE: How now! Must we listen to the law
again to-day, Portia? Go to—let’s get on!</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Oh well, what were done, when ’tis
done then ’twere well it were done quickly. Madam
Secretary—the minutes.</p>

<p>PORTIA: (reading) The 12th meeting of the Shakespeare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
Garden Club was held on March 15th (interruption
from a member) Oh the Ides of March! The Ides
of March. (grows faint and is fanned by companions.)</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: Poor soul, that is Caesar’s wife.</p>

<p>PORTIA: (continues) The meeting was at the home of
Juliet Montague and was addressed by Will Shakespeare
himself, who hath told us in strong words of the
unsightly condition of the banks of the River Avon.
Willow trees uprooted, old rushes strewn about; broken
flagons, and stray odds and ends of all unsavory things,
even unto defunct felines, lie on the edge of our lovely
waterway, and it was urged by our most beloved
leader that this Club take the matter in hand and clear
away the filth and grow Plants, Flowers and Fruits
along the river’s banks. ’Twas moved by Desdemona,
seconded by Rosalind, and carried that our Garden Club
should attend unto this work.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (rising) Enough! Thus thou must
do, if thou’d have it, let us hear what our members
have in mind.</p>

<p>PORTIA: Madam President, there is more to read.</p>

<p>JESSICA: Sit you down, Portia, and let me read my
report upon the ducats in our treasury.</p>

<p>PORTIA: Jessica, thou art indeed thy father’s child.
Shylock ever thought upon the ducats.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies, enough of this. Ambition for
our Club is our dear wish. Let’s on with business. Who
hath considered this matter and can name some fair
flowers to carpet Avon’s banks?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(looks about questioningly, a member rises)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="indentleft">Ah Titania!</span></p>

<p>TITANIA: Madam President, my suggestions come from
realms of fairy land as I dream, half-waking, on a bank
where the wild thyme blows; where oxlips and the nodding
violet grows. Quite over canopied with luscious
woodbine, with sweet musk roses, and with eglantine.
I dream of pease blossoms and mustard seed and
canker roses (tho some call them wild) and honeysuckle
and ivy—(which I trow is feminine because it requires
support). I give you dewberries and apricots, and love-in-idleness,
and there is cupid’s flower and Dian’s bud,
which is but an herb, but brewed will keep men and
women chaste.</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (aside) Best brew some for Cleopatra.</p>

<p>TITANIA: (continues) These, Madam President, are what
I would grow on Avon’s marshy banks. (sits down)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Titania hath named a worthy list, let
all in favor signify in the usual way.</p>

<p class="center">(Members applaud and murmur “aye, aye”)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (looking about) Juliet, do I see you
wish to speak?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>JULIET: Madam President, Romeo says the plaintain leaf
is most excellent for healing bruises, why not grow that?
And Friar Lawrence knows many precious juic-ed flowers
that kill the poisons of baleful weeds. Such weeds as
the mandrake that shrieks like living mortals when torn
from the earth. And surely we must have a pomegranate
tree, for Romeo and I both know that the nightingale
loves to sing in the branches, and the nightingale sings
far sweeter than the lark.</p>

<p>JESSICA: Oh you romantic child, still thinking of your
honeymoon.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies, your approval? (Applause
and “ayes”)</p>

<p>OPHELIA: (very timidly) Madam President?</p>

<p>KATHERINE: (aside) Have we to listen to Ophelia?
Everyone knows she hath bats in her belfry.</p>

<p>ROSALIND: Hush, Kate, Hamlet hath changed her mind
since they were wed, she’s sane enough now.</p>

<p>KATHERINE: Hamlet and Petrucio must be of the same
kin, Petrucio made me change some, forsooth.</p>

<p>OPHELIA: (in louder tones) Madam President.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ah Ophelia, speak up my child.</p>

<p>OPHELIA: Madam, I move we plant rosemary, that’s for
remembrance and a chosen emblem for weddings and
funerals. And pansies, they’re for thought, tho Madam
Titania called them “love-in-idleness.” Fennel, too, we
should have, that’s for flatterers, tho some say the gladiators
mixed it with their daily food, to make them fierce
and rude. Columbine is pretty, but it means unfaithfulness—and
forsaken lovers—let’s not plant that. Then
we must have rue, for its other name is herb of grace—we
all need that. And daisies, shall we plant those?
They mean to “dissemble.” But oh dear Madam, I pray
you let us have violets—and violets and violets, for they
mean faithfulness. (sits down)</p>

<p>KATHERINE: Madam President, I move we cheer Ophelia,
she hath told us useful things. (Members—“Aye,
aye, aye!”)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (Raps for quiet) Peace ladies, time
passes, we must hasten, are there more suggestions?</p>

<p>PERDITA: Madam President—Now Jove give me courage,
I do so tremble when I speak—we should plant lavender
and mint, and savory, and marjoram, and pale primroses—fairest
flowers of their season would show star-like
on Avon’s banks, while the flower-de-luce and crown
imperial would rear their lily heads in majesty gainst
the foliage of willows. We could also have carnations
and gillyvors, tho I like them not.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(sits down hastily)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>KATHERINE: Madam President. Perdita is so shy she
will not tell why she likes not the carnation and the
gillyvors, but I know ’tis because they both are streaked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
with red and white and look like painted women.</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (aside) Let’s call Cleopatra “gilly” for
short.</p>

<p>CORDELIA: Madam President.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Cordelia has the floor.</p>

<p>CORDELIA: Ladies, I ask your indulgence while I tell you
a short but sweet tale of the Crown Imperial. This
flower, which we sometimes call the Canterbury Bells,
was first made white and erect and grew to its full beauty
in the Garden of Gethsemane where it was oft noted and
admired by our Lord, but on the night of the Agony, as
he passed through the Garden, all the other flowers
bowed their heads in sorrowful adoration, save the
Crown Imperial, which alone remained with its head
unbowed, but not for long. Sorrow and shame soon
took the place of pride, and tears and painful blushes
followed, and so hath she ever remained with bent
blossoms unto this very day. (Murmurs and nods from
members)</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (aside) Did I not say Cordelia was a
fine religious woman?</p>

<p>ROSALINE: Madam President?</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Rosaline, my dear, I rejoice to hear
you speak.</p>

<p>ROSALINE: Dear Madam, I recall a sweet song of my
childhood, learned before I knew that sometimes Love’s
Labor’s Lost. It paints a picture of springtime. (Sings)</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When daisies pied and violets blue</div>
<div class="verse">And lady-smocks all silver white</div>
<div class="verse">And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue</div>
<div class="verse">Do paint the meadows with delight.</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="indentleft">Surely this would apply to Avon’s banks as well.</span></p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Quite likely, child, ’tis a pretty chant,
we thank you. (looks slowly around circle) Ah, Cleopatra,
have you no suggestions?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Cleopatra rises languidly and poses)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>CLEOPATRA: Madam President, age cannot wither, nor
custom stale the infinite variety of my memories of
Egypt’s bounteous blooms; but alas! They would
shrivel and die in your cold clime. Would that you
might see green figs grow, and ripe luscious olives. And
Oh for a glimpse of the date trees on the Nile, or a whiff
of the orange blossoms’ perfume. Could you but
imagine the beauty of the lemon tree heavy with golden
fruit, or the loveliness of the lime. The dusky purple
of Egypt’s wine-like grapes lies ever in mine eye, and I
dream of the wondrous green of the Aspic vine. Yet
perchance that which I love most is the polished sheen
of laurel leaves, for Anthony and I wore laurel chaplets
on our brows throughout the year. (Sinks back into
seat)</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: My word, she treats us English like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
30 farthings.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: My lady Cleopatra hath told us what
we may not have.</p>

<p>OPHELIA: (rising hastily) Dear lady, let me tell you
what we must not have, ’tis aconite, bracken, bramble
and brier, burs, burdock and cockle, duckweed and hemlock,
insane-root, nettles and opium. All these are evil
things. Let’s none of them.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(Members murmur and shiver)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p>PORTIA: The law would call this a process of elimination.</p>

<p>ROSALIND: Madam President, I speak for the greenwood
tree, for trees are my delight. ’Twas but a while ago
that I found a man haunting the forest and abusing our
young plants with carving “Rosalind” on their bark.
Hanging odes on Hawthornes, and elegies on brambles—forsooth
deifying the name of Rosalind. I soon stopped
that.</p>

<p>KATHERINE: Brave girl, what did you do?</p>

<p>ROSALIND: (laughing) I married him.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Mistress Ford, have you a thought to
add to our growing list?</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: (rising and bowing low) My lady, I
thank you for your courtesy to one outside your club,
and being a good housewife I would speak for grains.
You should plant barley, corn and oats, rye and wheat.
Then too, there’s spices, ginger, nutmeg and mace—oh
yes, and mustard, thyme and savory.</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: (rising quickly) Dear Madam, I, too,
am a good housewife, pray let me speak for what we
can never neglect, good vegetables. There’s cabbage and
carrots, beans and peas, lettuce and mushrooms, and
onions, garlic and leeks.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies! Mine ears are weighted with
sounds of food. Pray let us not consider onions—garlic
and leeks—or all the perfume of Arabia will not sweeten
this little land.</p>

<p>CORDELIA: Dear Madam, I fear to annoy, but would
the name of berries fall heavy on thine ear? We should
grow some of these along the bank; say blueberries and
blackberries, currants, and dewberries, gooseberries, mulberries
and strawberries, and if we grow strawberries
we must remember that our own King Henry the Fifth
hath said: “The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
and wholesome berries thrive and ripen best, neighbored
by fruit of baser quality.” Are we humans like
that, I wonder?</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: (Turning to Portia) Madam Secretary,
are you able to make notes—these thoughts come
in thick and fast.</p>

<p>PORTIA: Aye, Madam, and I crave your mercy, and beg
that the quality of mercy is not strained, for Ann
Hathaway has asked that we leave not out of our discussion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the trees that Master Shakespeare loves so well.
If a suggestion from me comes not amiss, it would seem
wise that our members now sitting in this half circle
should try, as in our childhood games, to name the trees
in order, alphabetical, each taking her turn according to
the letter, what say you, Madam?</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Most admirable. Shall we begin at
this end with Mistress Page?</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: Do I understand that I am to name
all trees I canst remember beginning with the letter ‘A?’</p>

<p>PORTIA: That is my thought, and when you have finished
just tap your neighbor and she will start with ‘B.’</p>

<p>MISTRESS PAGE: (Thoughtfully) Almond, ash, aspen,
apple, that’s all. (taps Mistress Ford)</p>

<p>MISTRESS FORD: Balsam, bay, birch, box.</p>
</div>


<p class="center">(much excitement among members, all trying to think,
etc.) (Much original business)</p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p>NEXT: Cherry, chestnut, crabapple, cypress.</p>

<p>NEXT: Elm and elder.</p>

<p>NEXT: Fig, filbert and fir.</p>

<p>NEXT: Hazlenut and holly.</p>

<p>NEXT: Lemon, lime and linden.</p>

<p>NEXT: Quince.</p>

<p>NEXT: Sycamore.</p>

<p>NEXT: Walnut and willow.</p>

<p>NEXT: Yew-tree.</p>

<p>ANN HATHAWAY: Will Shakespeare would love that
game, and thank the players, ’tis a goodly list of trees
to cast welcome shade on Avon’s banks.</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: Ladies, we may rest content, our
meeting hath accomplished much, is there further discussion
for our Garden Club?</p>

<p>DESDEMONA: Madam, my husband’s friend, Iago, (tho
I like nor trust him not) hath a pretty wit and hath
likened us to gardens in these words: “Our bodies are
our gardens, to which our wills are gardeners, so that if
we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop, and
weed up thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
distract it with many, either to have it sterile with
idleness or manured with industry, why the power and
corrigible authority of this lies in our wills.” (sits down)</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH: True, child, very true. Ladies, let me
prophesy, that when our members have died, and worms
have eaten them and Master Shakespeare himself hath
become but ancient history—garden clubs in times to
come will remember fair Avon’s shores made lovely by
your sweet suggestions.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
